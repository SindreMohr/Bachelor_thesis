# Work Plan

## Part #1 (Problem Statement)

Define the problem statement

1. Which problem are you addressing and why is it important?
2. What are the Inputs and outputs of the model?
3. Is it Regression or classification problem?
4. Supervised or unsupervised problem?

_\*\*\*Prepare a short introduction to the task_

</br>

## Part #2 (Data Exploration)

1. Find a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/) or any other places. The dataset should be publicly available.
2. Provide statistics summary of dataset
3. Do data visualization to express and demonstrate key relationships and get a qualitative understanding of most data that you come across.

_\*\*\*Prepare a short description on the dataset_

</br>

## Part #3 (Data Preprocessing)

1. Choose and apply the preprocessing techniques that are necessary. (For example remove the dates with a lot of missing values, fill in missing values with few missing values, remove outliers if any.
2. Split the dataset into a train and test set (train will be used to train your machine learning model and test set will be used to evaluate your model)

</br>

## Part #4 (Design Test Harness)

This are the process of model:

1. Fit a candidate model on the training dataset
2. MAKE classification/Regression on the test set
3. Calculate a metric that compares the predictions to the expected value
4. Test models: test many models using your test harness

</br>

## Part #5 (Developing Models)

Some common classes of methods that you can design experiments around include the following: (the order in the list is important; from classical to modern models, the complexity increases). Feel free to choose other models as well.

1. Autoregression, such as ARIMA
2. Deep learning: MLP, LSTM, and hybrid models
